# Create our own data set with test cases from Leetcode:
- Each of us will select 10 random leetcode problems (4 easy, 4 medium, 2 hard)
- For each problem, manually alter the solution resulting in one logically incorrect solution and one syntactically incorrect solution
- Keep track of the problem number and the difficulty
- Link to Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IVpkTNftBr5n0cqDMR8EBs-C95loa0s4usKulx7L6ug/edit#gid=0

# Github 
## Solutions folder
- Each file is the base solution we used to modify the problem in a .txt file, the title is  [problem number].txt
## Altered_solutions folder
- Each file is the manually altered solution in a .txt, the title is [problem number]_syntactic.txt or [problem number]_logic.txt depending on how we changed the base solution
